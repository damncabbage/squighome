I basically just had a hidden div using a monospace font containing a single character. I got the width of that div on the fly, calculated how many times it would fit on one line on the screen, then kept that value in... let's say max_chars.

On load, I'd put the contents of a text file inside it. Before I put it on the page, I put x spaces before each line, where x = (max_chars - the length of the longest line) รท 2, then put the padded text in a <pre> block on the page. Because this also fired when the viewport was resized, x constantly adjusted to the growing or shrinking page size. That way I had a constantly-centred block of text on the page without any CSS styling, thereby keeping that old readme vibe intact. And because the font in that hidden div was whatever monospace font the visitor's system used, the amount of characters that would fit on the screen  would adjust to whatever font the visitor's browser rendered it in.
